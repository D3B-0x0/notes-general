*Variable is the name of a memory location which stores some data..*

**Example** 
*int* number = 69
*char* basically_anything = 'bruh'
*float* pi = 3.14

##### Some points to remember while working with variables

- Variables are case sensitive *(a = 6 ,A =9)both are different memory locations* 
- 1st character is alphabet or underscore..not anything else even white-space or a number
- No other symbol rather than underscore "_" can be used for naming of variables
- Variables as per the name means something which can change anytime
- Always use correct variable name as per the program for good understanding.


#### Data types

| Data Type       | Description       | Size    | Example                            |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `int`           | Integer           | 4 bytes | `int x = 5;`                       |
| `char`          | Character         | 1 byte  | `char c = 'a';`                    |
| `float`         | Floating Point    | 4 bytes | `float f = 3.14;`                  |
| `double`        | Double Precision  | 8 bytes | `double d = 3.14159;`              |
| `void`          | No value          | -       | `void *ptr;`                       |
| `unsigned int`  | Unsigned Int      | 4 bytes | `unsigned int ui = 5;`             |
| `long`          | Long Integer      | 8 bytes | `long l = 123456789;`              |
| `short`         | Short Integer     | 2 bytes | `short s = 100;`                   |
| `long long`     | Long Long Integer | 8 bytes | `long long ll = 123456789012;`     |
| `unsigned long` | Unsigned Long     | 8 bytes | `unsigned long ul = 5;`            |
| `enum`          | Enumeration       | -       | `enum color { red, green, blue };` |
| `struct`        | Structure         | -       | `struct point { int x, y; };`      |
| `union`         | Union             | -       | `union data { int i; float f; };`  |
**Btw boolean or string datatype doesn't exist in C**
