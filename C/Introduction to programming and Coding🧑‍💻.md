##### **2.What is C (language)?

- C is a programming language which is one of the oldest and finest programming language.This is the most used language for talking with very low level stuff like hardware and embedded technology.

- C was developed by [Dennis Ritchie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie) at [AT&T's Bell Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs)which is a telecom company or networking firm we could say.

- C is the program used in developing the *kernels* of these operating systems..
- C is used in making of *driver files* as mentioned before because of the ability of performing very good with low level stuffs..
- C is very widely used in [[Embedded systems]](Cameras,printers,Mobile-phones,handheld devices)because C is very fast in these spaces where every bit of performance is needed..
- C is used to develop [games](https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/15389/what-popular-famous-games-are-written-in-c#15391) where [[LATENCYüìà]] is very important 
- There are endless uses of C in the world of COMPUTERSüñ•Ô∏è
