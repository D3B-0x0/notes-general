## Comments

There are two types of Comment structure followed in C.
Comments are basically lines which are ignored by the compiler and are only effective for the end user or the developer...basically using comments is useful for explaining a specific part of code about what it is doing...

**Single line comments :-** `//Hi this is just a simple comment :)`

**Multi line comments :-**

```
/*
this is an example of multiline comments which is enclosed within backslash and star
