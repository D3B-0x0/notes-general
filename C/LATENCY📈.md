Latency in computers
 - The time delay between a request and the response.
 - Measured in milliseconds (ms)
 - Happens in many areas of computing, including:
     - Network latency: Time it takes for a data packet to travel from one point to another.
     - Disk latency: Time it takes for a hard drive to access data.
     - CPU latency: Time it takes for the CPU to process a request.
 - Lower latency is generally better as it means things happen faster.
